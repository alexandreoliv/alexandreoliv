### AI Full-Stack Engineer

I'm an experienced software engineer building scalable, AI-powered full-stack applications end to end, from architecture to deployment. I specialise in designing and delivering production-ready systems with automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native infrastructure.

With a background in both frontend and backend development, I move fast across the stack. I'm focused on building AI-driven tools and products that actually ship.
